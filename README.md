something cool. #pivot
Our [original idea](https://github.com/udpatil/AR-RoboCar) was an Robot that moved using Android's ARCore, but due to difficulties with OpenCV in Android Studio, we decided to pivot to something with data viz in mind.

### Idea
Use sentiment analysis to analyze tweets and reddit comments
